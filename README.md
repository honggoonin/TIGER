# TiGER: Tiny bandwidth key encapsulation mechanism for easy miGration based on RLWE(R)

This project contains the implementation and Known Answer Test (KAT) results of our KEM scheme, __TiGER__. This work is submitted to 'Korean Post-Quantum Cryptography Competition'(www.kpqc.or.kr).

## KAT
This directory contains KAT results and scripts to perform KAT of __TiGER128__, __TiGER192__, __TiGER256__.
In particular, ```run_KAT.sh``` repeats and updates KAT values based on latest reference implementation.  


## Update News
11/29/22 initial commit of reference implementation and KAT
